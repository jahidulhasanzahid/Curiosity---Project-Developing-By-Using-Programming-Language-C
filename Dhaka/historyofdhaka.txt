									History of Dhaka
								______________________________
	Dhaka, formerly spelled as Dacca in English, is the capital and one of the oldest cities of Bangladesh. The history of Dhaka begins with 
	the existence of urbanised settlements in the area that is now Dhaka dating from the 7th century CE. The city area was ruled by the Buddhist 
	kingdom of Kamarupa before passing to the control of the Sena dynasty in the 9th century CE.[2] After the Sena dynasty, Dhaka was successively 
	ruled by the Turkic and Afghan governors descending from the Delhi Sultanate before the arrival of the Mughals in 1608. After Mughals, British 
	ruled the region for over 150 years until the independence of India. In 1947, Dhaka became the capital of the East Bengal province under the 
	dominion of Pakistan. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Dhaka became the capital of the new state.
