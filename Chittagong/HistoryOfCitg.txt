								History Of Chittagong City
							_______________________________________
	Chittagong has been a seaport since ancient times. The region was home to the ancient Bengali Buddhist Samatata and Harikela states.It later fell 
	under of the rule of the Gupta Empire, the Pala Empire and the Vesali kingdom of Arakan till the 7th century. Arabs traded with the port from the 
	9th century AD. An account by historian Lama Taranath has revealed a Buddhist king Gopichandra had his capital at Chittagong in the 10th century, 
	and according to Tibetan tradition, Chittagong was the birthplace of 10th century Buddhist Tantric Tilayogi.In the Fourteenth Century, explorer 
	Ibn Battuta passed through Chittagong during his travels.
	Sultan Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah of Sonargaon conquered Chittagong in 1340 AD.Sultan Giasuddin Mubarak Shah constructed a highway from Chittagong 
	to Chandpur and ordered the construction of many lavish mosques and tombs. After the defeat of Mahmud Shah in the hands of Sher Shah in 1538, the 
	Arakanese Kingdom of Mrauk U regained Chittagong. From this time onward, until its conquest by the Mughals, this region was under the control of the 
	Portuguese and the Magh pirates (a notorious name for Arakanese) for 128 years.
	Chittaong grew at the beginning of the twentieth century after the partition of Bengal and the creation of the province of Eastern Bengal and Assam.
	The construction of the Assam Bengal Railway to Chittagong facilitated further development of economic growth in the city. However, revolutionaries 
	and opposition movements grew during this time. Many people in Chittagong supported Khilafat and Non-Cooperation movements.
