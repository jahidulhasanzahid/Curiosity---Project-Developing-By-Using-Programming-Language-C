									The Culture of Bangladesh
								__________________________________________
The Culture of Bangladesh (Bengali:Bangladesher Sôngskr?iti) refers to the way of life of the people of Bangladesh. It has evolved over the centuries and encompasses 
the cultural diversity of several social groups of Bangladesh. The Bengal Renaissance of the 19th and early 20th centuries, noted Bengali writers, saints, authors, 
scientists, researchers, thinkers, music composers, painters, and film-makers have played a significant role in the development of Bengali culture. The Bengal 
Renaissance contained the seeds of a nascent political Indian nationalism and was the precursor in many ways to modern Indian artistic and cultural expression. 
The culture of Bangladesh is composite and over the centuries has assimilated influences of Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity. It is manifested in various 
forms, including music, dance, and drama; art and craft; folklore and folktale; languages and literature; philosophy and religion; festivals and celebrations; as 
well as in a distinct cuisine and culinary tradition.
